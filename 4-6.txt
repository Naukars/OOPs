Q.4 What is DataType?

A data type tells Java what kind of value is stored and what operations are valid, ensuring type safety at compile time. 
Common categories are primitive types and reference types.

Q.5 Different Types of Data Types.

Primitive types are the basic building blocks like int, double, boolean, and char; they store actual values and live on the stack. 
Reference types store references to objects (arrays, classes, interfaces) on the heap.

Q.6 What is a Variable?

A variable is a named storage location with a type; it can hold a value that may change during execution. 
Its scope and lifetime depend on where it’s declared (local, instance, or static)
